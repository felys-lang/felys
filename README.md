## What is the Felys Programming Language?

Felys is a programming language written in Rust. The motivation is to create a language where Elysia exists, so regardless of how this project evolves in the future, there must exist a built-in identifier named `__elysia__`. Feel free to try it using the online [playground](https://exec.felys.dev/).

## Highlights and Stories

There is a clean [packrat](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~baford/packrat/thesis/thesis.pdf) parser implementation that supports left recursion and unifies tokenization and parsing. The performance is actually not bad as everything is built on standard library.

I witnessed the story of [Elysia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZg6Qqx_o9U) in my second last year in high school and graduated with [Kiana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7j8VFU6SIg) the next year. These are pretty much the only delightful part I would recall from that period. After coming to the college, life gets better, but I can no longer put myself into anything beyond studying or working. Thus, I created this project to make the sweetest memory immortal.
