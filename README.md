## What is the Felys programming Language?

Felys is a functional programming language written in Rust. The motivation is to create a language where Elysia exists, so regardless of how this project gets developed in the future, there must exist a built-in identifier called `__elysia__`. Although it is just a toy language, the implementation is quite elegant without ugly hacks. Feel free to try it on the online [playground](https://exec.felys.dev/).
