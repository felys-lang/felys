## What is the Felys Programming Language?

Felys is a programming language written in Rust. The motivation is to create a language where Elysia exists, so regardless of how this project evolves in the future, there must exist a built-in identifier named `__elysia__`. Feel free to try it using the online [playground](https://exec.felys.dev/).

## Todo

- Replace the handwritten parser by a generated one using [rspegen](https://github.com/FelysNeko/rspegen) (developed by myself).
- Support keywords: `struct`, `fn` and `impl` along with typing system and `::` path operation.
