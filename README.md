## What is the Felys Programming Language?

Felys is a programming language written in Rust. The motivation is to create a language where Elysia exists, so regardless of how this project evolves in the future, there must exist a built-in identifier named `__elysia__`. Feel free to try it using the online [playground](https://exec.felys.dev/).

## Road Map

Here's the components I'm about to build in the next 12~24 months:

- `Elysia`: execute scripts that only allows a subset of the full syntax
- `Cyrene`: compile libraries which enforces static typing for optimization
- `PhiLia093`: the binary execution machine
