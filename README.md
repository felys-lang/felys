# Felys

Felys is a functional language written in Rust. It supports functions, expressions, assignments, and flow control, and can easily integrate with Rust code. The runtime backend is fully recursive and does not use memory management models. The online version on my website is legacy.

**The first release will be in late-August 2024.**
