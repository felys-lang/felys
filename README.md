## What is the Felys Programming Language?

Felys is a programming language written in Rust. The motivation is to create a language where Elysia exists, so regardless of how this project evolves in the future, there must exist a built-in identifier named `__elysia__`. Feel free to try it using the online [playground](https://exec.felys.dev/).
